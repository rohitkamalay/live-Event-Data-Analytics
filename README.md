# ABSTRACT 

Track and analyze user interactions with a product or service in real-time or near real-time. This involves collecting, processing, and storing event data and using powerful analysis tools to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. The insights gained from event-based analytics can help businesses optimize their operations, improve their products and services, and enhance customer experiences. The task also includes integrating event-based analytics with other systems and processes within the organization while ensuring data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations. 

Live event data analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data generated during a live event. With the advent of technology, the collection of data has become more efficient and effective, making it possible to analyze data in real-time. This has 
revolutionized the way live events are managed, creating opportunities for organizers to improve attendee experiences, increase revenue, and optimize resources. This paper will examine the role of live event data analytics in improving the management of live events, including its benefits, challenges, and emerging trends. However, there are also challenges associated with live event data analytics. Firstly, collecting and analyzing data in real-time requires sophisticated technology and expertise, which can be costly and time-consuming. Secondly, data privacy and security must be carefully managed to protect the personal information of attendees. Thirdly, the data collected must be relevant and actionable to be useful, which requires careful planning and execution. 

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 
Exploratory data analysis is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

# CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, live event data analytics has transformed the management of live events, providing organizers with valuable insights into attendee behavior, optimizing resource allocation, and increasing revenue. While there are challenges associated with collecting and analyzing data in real-time, the benefits of using data analytics are significant, and the field is expected to grow in the coming years. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more sophisticated data analytics solutions that will further enhance the live event experience. This data analytics project aimed to track Live event using exploratory data analysis models and various data sources. Through exploratory data analysis, we identified several factors that contribute to track the events. We then used feature engineering techniques to create new features from the data and selected the Regression Analysis as our final model based on its performance on the testing data. Our results showed that our final model was able to accurately track events and analyze the data, which is a significant improvement over the baseline model.

# Live event data analysis has a significant potential for growth and innovation. Some future scopes for live event data analysis are: 

1. Predictive analysis: Predictive analysis will be a significant area of focus for live event data analysis. By analyzing real-time data, it will be possible to predict event trends, attendee behavior, and engagement levels. This information can be used to optimize the event experience and improve ROI. 

2. Personalization: Personalization is the key to delivering a superior event experience. By analyzing data on attendees, including their interests, preferences, and behavior, event organizers can personalize the event experience for each attendee. 

3. Real-time data visualization: Real-time data visualization will become increasingly important for live event data analysis. Event organizers will need to be able to visualize data in real-time, so they can respond quickly to changes in attendance, engagement, and other metrics. 

4. Machine learning: Machine learning will be a game-changer for live event data analysis. By using machine learning algorithms, it will be possible to identify patterns in data, predict outcomes, and make data-driven decisions in real-time. 

5. Improved attendee engagement: Event organizers will use data analysis to create more engaging events. By analyzing attendee behavior, they will be able to identify areas where engagement is low and make changes to improve the attendee experience. 

Overall, the future scope for live event data analysis is promising, and we can expect to see significant advancements in this field in the years to come.
